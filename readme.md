In this episode we'll look at **serving content** from [Koajs](http://koajs.com/ "koajs") with [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/ "swig"): a _fast_, _extensible_ and popular templating language available in node.js and in the browser.

This is the **second** episode in a **three** part series on serving content from Koajs.  In the first episode we looked at [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/ "Jade"), an _excellent_ , _unique_ and _popular_ templating language.  This week we'll **contrast** **Jade** with a more more conventional choice: **Swig**.

Swig can be **appealing** for several reasons:

*   It simply **intermixes** the **templating** syntax with **html**, which makes for a _smaller_ _learning curve_ when compared to Jade.
*   It's one of the **fastest** templating engines available in node.js. So if you can't stand the thought of using anything but the fastest engine, swig may be for you.
*   It offers **simple extensibility** so adding functionality is a breeze
We'll continue to explore and learn by **creating tests**, which provides an excellent way to **validate** our _assumptions_, _expectations_ and _understanding_.

Were going to focus on _using_ _swig_ in the _context_ of a _Koajs_ application, so well setup our tests to call a Koajs application that will render our swig templates and return the resulting html.

Next we'll _look_ at a significant portion of the **_features_** available in _swig_ by creating a series of tests.

Lastly we'll **extend** **swigs** functionality, creating a couple of _custom_ _filters_ such as _pluralize_.

Stay tuned for the next episode, where we look at **Marko** a _new_ and _interesting_ **templating language** that provides some **interesting** **features** and **performance** characteristics.
